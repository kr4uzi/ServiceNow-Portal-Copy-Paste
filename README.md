Enables Copy & Paste + Drag & Drop and all forms.
Since Vancouver, this feature is finally out of the box and this app is no longer required.
In the OOTB version you need to click the attachment icon which opens a popup where a drop zone for attachments is created (and copy&paste is detected).

If you still want to use this application (e.g. because you want attachment handling without a poup), please note that I do not longer offer any support for it.
